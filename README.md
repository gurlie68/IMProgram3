# IMProgram3
Iterative and Recursive
Project 3
This programming project involves writing a program to calculate the terms of the following sequence of
numbers: 0 1 2 5 12 29 ... where each term of the sequence is twice the previous term plus the second
previous term. The 0th term of the sequence is 0 and the 1st term of the sequence is 1.
For example:
0 1 2 -> (0 + 1 + 2) + 2 = 5
0 1 2 5 -> (0 + 1 + 2 + 5) + 5 = 12
0 1 2 5 12 -> (0 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 12) + 12 = 29
â€¦
The interface to the program should be a GUI that looks similar to the following:
The pair of radio buttons allows the user to choose whether an iterative or recursive method is used to
compute the term of the sequence. When the user enters a value for n and then clicks the Compute button,
the n
th term of the sequence should be displayed in the Result field. The Efficiency field should contain the
number of calls to the recursive method when the recursive option is chosen and the number of iterations
of the loop when the iterative option is selected.
The Iterative radio button should be initially set to selected.
When the window is closed, the efficiency values should be computed with values of n from 0 to 10 and
written to a file. Each line of the file should contain the value of n, the efficiency of the iterative method
for that value of n and the efficiency of the recursive method. The values should be separated by commas
so the file can be opened with Excel and used to graph the value of the efficiencies for both the iterative
and recursive options along the y axis with the value of n along the x-axis. The graph should be included
in the Word document that accompanies this project and should also contain a brief explanation of the
observed results.
The program should consist of two classes.
1. The first class should define the GUI. In addition to the main method and a constructor to build
the GUI, an event handler will be needed to handle the Compute button click and another handler
will be needed to produce the file described above when the window is closed. The latter handler
should be an object of an inner class that extends the WindowAdapter class.

2. The other class should be named Sequence. It should be a utility class meaning that all its
methods must be class (static) methods and no objects should be able to be generated for that
class. It should contain three public methods:
a. The first method computeIterative should accept a value of n and return the corresponding
element in the sequence using iteration.
b. The second method computeRecursive should accept a value of n and return the
corresponding element in the sequence using recursion. This method will be a helper method
because it will need to initialize the efficiency counter before calling the private recursive
method that will actually perform the recursive computation.
c. The third method getEfficiency will return the efficiency counter left behind by the previous
call to either of the above two methods.
